Pointers and Bubbles Algorithm
Ryan Eades

Goals: 
Use Andy's starter code to create a program that can output an ordered array. For the base assignment, this will have been assigned within the program. 

Input(main function): None for base assignment. 
Output(main function): Two strings. One to preface the original array being printed and one to preface the final array being printed.

Input(printValues function): No values passed to the function in the base assignment. It will use the global variable values(the array of numbers).
Output(printValues function): No return value. Within the function it prints the values array.

Input(sort function): 
Output(sort function):

Input(swap function): Two pointers are passed to it. 
Output(swap function): The pointers are outputted, having been swapped

Steps:
1. Create a main function exactly like Andy's.

2. Create a swap function that takes two pointers and swaps them
	a. Assign each pointer to a variable.(these variables should stay the same within the whole function)  
	b. Assign the second pointer's value to the value at the pointer to the first pointer and vice versa.
	
3. Create a sort function with the algorithm provided. Except have it call the printValues function after each swap.

4. Create a printValues function that will print out the values array.
	a. Print left bracket
	b. Loop through the values array printing out each value
	c. Print right bracket
